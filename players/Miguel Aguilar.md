Aguilar started 10 seasons with the Fraser Valley Pioneers but was traded in the middle of 1931 to the Swift Current Saints, who needed some star power to make a run at the pennant. That succeeded, but they didn't manage to win. In 1932 he led the team to the pennant again, but this time the Pioneers were the opponent and they lost again, [[1932#Game 5|losing one game]] specifically because of his error.
