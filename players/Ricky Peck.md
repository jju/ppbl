One of only 25 players from the inauguration of the PPC, Peck has been a reliable workhorse. After a very good rookie campaign where he claimed 15 wins and his single HR allowed got him an end-of-season award he scuffled in 1922 not getting the run-support he needed to win games. He was sent down to the farm to work things out in 1923 and returned a winning pitcher.
In his 10th season he proved his longevity by returning to his rookie form, giving up 0 Home Runs despite a near-career-high number of innings pitched.
