# Prairie Pacific Championship

## Game 1 
(SID 0 - MJ 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* MJ Luke Simmons 9-6 ERA 3.04
* SID Fernando Dixon 16-7 ERA 2.2

| Inning | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | Runs | Hits | Err |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MJ | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 1 | 6 | 2 |
| SID | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | - | - | 3 | 7 | 1 |

An excellent duel of the pitchers until the bottom of the order in the 8th got on board due to an error by the Monarchs' Clifford Alvarez. That allowed a crack and two more got on base. A 3-run pinch-hit homer by Nawel Hayden got the Loggers their win.

## Game 2 
(SID 1 - MJ 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* MJ Tom Griffin 15-5 ERA 2.00
* SID Calvin Burton 17-2 ERA 1.43

| Inning | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | Runs | Hits | Err |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MJ | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | - | 5 | 12 | 1 |
| SID | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 3 | 8 | 0 |


Clifford Alvarez made up for his game 1 blunder by hitting the game-winning 2-run homer in the 7th inning.

## Game 3 
(SID 1 - MJ 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SID Jeremiah Lee 17-4 ERA 1.57
* MJ Dale Burton 8-6 ERA 1.60

| Inning | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | Runs | Hits | Err |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SID | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 2 | 5 | 1 |
| MJ | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 1 | 6 | 0 |


Sidney's batters weren't at their best so we saw a changed up lineup that proved effective enough. Dale Burton wiggled out of two bases-loaded jams in this game, but 3 walks got the better of him in the 6th, and that combined with a hit and a hard grounder made the difference.

## Game 4 
(SID 2 - MJ 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SID Hunter Harvey 9-4 ERA 1.22
* MJ Breanna Richardson 3-1 ERA 1.04

| Inning | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--:|---|
| SID    | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | - | 3 | 4 | 2 |
| MJ     | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | - | - | 4 | 11 | 0 |

Richardson got so few decisions this season despite pitching so well, it was almost heartbreaking to see Benito Esteban give up 2 runs when he came in to close out the game. But the Monarchs tied up the series with her gutsy performance.

## Game 5 
(SID 2 - MJ 2)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SID: Fernando Dixon 1-0
* MJ: Hector Cunningham 14-5 ERA 0.94

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SID | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 1 | 4 | 1 |
| MJ  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 0 | 5 | 0 |

Aggressive baserunning was the Monarchs' downfall, even letting Aiden Holland's heroic wiggling out of a bases loaded jam in the top of the 9th, giving anyone the chance to tie it up with a swing. But the Loggers balled.


## Game 6
(SID 3 - MJ 2)

Starting Pitchers: 
* MJ

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MJ  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 6 | 7 | 0 |
| SID | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 2 | 7 | 1 |

LF Error opened the floodgates and lost the game (which had been tied).

## Game 7 if necessary

Starting Pitchers: 

* MJ: Tom Griffin


| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MJ  | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | - | 4 | 6 | 1 |
| SID | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 0 | 4 | 0 |


Three home runs in the first inning gave Tom Griffin a comfortable cushion from which to win the game. After Hunter Harvey the Loggers threw all their best relievers out there to limit the damage, but their bats never came around and the Monarchs won the Prairie Pacific Championship.
