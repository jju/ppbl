The Pacific Pennant came down to the wire with the Loggers and Grizzlies tied at 115 Wins for their final game, which was head to head. The Grizzlies had to sweep this final series and got the first two games but Daniels ran into trouble in the fifth on the third time through the order and sticking with him to the 4-0 loss cost the Grizzlies a chance for the championship.

# Prairie Pacific Championship

## Game 1 
(SID 0 - MJ 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* MJ Tom Griffin 16-4 ERA 1.42
* SID Calvin Burton 15-3 ERA 1.71

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MJ  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 8 | 0 |
| SID | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 8 | 0 |

A tense one throughout, both pitchers were on their games but neither got the decision. Moose Jaw's greatest problem may have been allowing Esteban to hit for himself in the 10th, which rolled into a double play. Nawel Hayden continued his postseason heroics by getting a pinch hit leadoff double in the 10th and then scoring off of 2 sac flies to win the game. Luis Gimenez played an amazing game for the Loggers too, and the place went wild for the game-tying HR in the bottom of the 9th.

## Game 2 
(SID 1 - MJ 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* MJ Breanna Richardson 16-5 ERA 1.74
* SID Jeremiah Lee 14-4 ERA 1.77

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MJ  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 0 | 7 | 1 |
| SID | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | - | - | 1 | 6 | 1 |

Another pitcher's duel without quite the same extra-inning comeback drama as Game 1, but still a great one. Richardson got hung with the loss without giving up an earned run because Esteban Sanchex booted the ball in the seventh.

## Game 3 
(SID 2 - MJ 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SID Fernando Dixon 16-3 ERA 1.77
* MJ Luke Simmmons 10-8 ERA 2.40

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SID | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | - | 2 | 4 | 0 |
| MJ  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | - | - | 3 | 8 | 0 |

It was close in the end because Simmmons fought the manager about how he didn't want to give up the complete game, but in the end Esteban got his one-batter save and the Monarchs avoid the sweep (at least).

## Game 4 
(SID 2 - MJ 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SID Hunter Harvey 20-3 ERA 1.76
* MJ Tom Griffin 16-4 ERA 1.42 (0-0)

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R  | H  | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|---|
| SID | 0 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | - | 12 | 16 | 0 |
| MJ  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - |  2 |  6 | 0 |

Hunter Harvey was going into this game on a short leash despite his stellar play this season but it was Tom Griffin who had a hellish game. Dylan Hayes got a hit every appearance and scored 4 runs.

## Game 5
(SID 3 - MJ 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SID: Calvin Burton 15-3 ERA 1.71 (0-0)
* MJ: Breanna Richardson 16-5 ERA 1.74 (0-1)

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SID | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | - | 3 | 5 | 0 |
| MJ  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 1 | 2 | 1 |

When Calvin Burton left the game with an injury in the fifth, the Monarchs' faces lit up. Now they'd get to deal with a managed game. But their lead was short-lived and they played the rest of things out to deal with extra innings. In the end, Sidney's relievers handled the Monarchs and their hitters took advantage of the Monarchs not having their best stuff.
