The standings look very similar to 1923 but we can notice a few differences. Offense was up around the league (though not to the crazy [[1921]] levels). The Sidney Loggers ended up defending their championship.

# Prairie Pacific Championship

## Game 1 
(SID 0 - MJ 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* MJ Luke Simmmons 13-6 ERA 2.55
* SID Fernando Dixon 19-2 ERA 1.93

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | R | H | E |

| SID | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |  0 | 2 | 8 | 0 |

A great game with both starters dealing, and nothing to show for it. Marc Mason was the star of the game with 3 stolen bases which led to 2 of the runs scored, including the winning one in the 10th.
* W: Harry Holland (1-0)
* L: Alvaro Martinez (0-1)

## Game 2 
(SID 0 - MJ 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* MJ Tom Griffin 18-7 ERA 2.45
* SID Calvin Burton 21-2 ERA 2.17

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |

| SID | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 | - | 7 | 8 | 0 |

Burton cruised through the lineup the first time but then 4 hits including a 3 run homer changed the game dramatically. The Loggers clawed back runs with homers of their own and then in the bottom of the 9th Dylan Hayes scored a 2-run blast (off a tiring Benito Esteban) when it looked like they were going to have to small-ball their way to a series tie.

* W: Byron Taylor (1-0)
* L: Benito Esteban (0-1)


## Game 3 
(SID 1 - MJ 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SID Jeremiah Lee 23-2 ERA 2.73
* MJ Dale Burton 15-8 ERA 2.83

| MJ  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 1 | 5 | 0 |

Rain delay in the 7th with the Loggers up 3-1 and Jose Wright just having gotten a pinch-hit walk. After the delay the Loggers finished things off to punish those who stuck it out in the stands.

* W: Jeremiah Lee (1-0)
* L: Dale Burton (0-1)
* Sv: Ben Murray (1)


## Game 4 
(SID 2 - MJ 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SID Hunter Harvey 22-1 ERA 1.89 (Fernando Dixon 19-2 ERA 1.93 had to be pushed back due to fatigue from game 1)
* MJ Breanna Richardson 14-7 ERA 1.66 (Luke Simmmons 13-6 ERA 2.55 had to be pushed back due to fatigue from game 1)

|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SID | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 4 | 7 | 1 |
| MJ  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | - | 5 | 14 | 2 |

Holy drama! Ignacio Rodriguez stole home with 2 outs to complete the comeback win for the Monarchs. [[1924-PPC-04-thesteal]]
* W: Zachary Tucker (1-0)
* L: Byron Taylor (1-1)

## Game 5
(SID 2 - MJ 2)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SID Fernando Dixon 19-2 ERA 1.93
* MJ Luke Simmmons 13-6 ERA 2.55

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |

| MJ  | 2 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | - | - | 8 | 9 | 1 |

So many home runs in this matchup, with two from Ruben Leon. Ignacio Rodriguez had a chance to bust the game open in the 3rd and was visibly disgusted when he couldn't drive in a run with the bases loaded.
* W: Luke Simmmons (1-0)
* L: Alvaro Martinez (0-2)
* Sv: Harry Holland (1)

## Game 6
(SID 2 - MJ 3)

Starting Pitchers: 
* MJ Tom Griffin 18-7 ERA 2.45
* SID Calvin Burton 21-2 ERA 2.17

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|---|---|---|

| SID | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 |  0 |  0 |  1 | 8 | 10 | 1 |

The Monarchs leapt out to an early lead, and were up 7-1 in the bottom of the ninth when everything fell apart. The Loggers batted around on the backs of two Marc Mason errors (after having two outs) in the inning. Then in the 12th with the heart of the order up, Dylan Hayes got on base, moved to second and Gina Gonzalez scored the walk-off double to force Game 7. The Loggers went through their entire bench and we were going to have to see relief pitchers batting if the game hadn't ended when it did.
* W: Wayne Murphy (1-0)
* L: Ricardo Campos (0-1)
* Sv: 

## Game 7 
(SID 3 - MJ 3)

Starting Pitchers: 

* MJ: Dale Burton 15-8 ERA 2.83
* SID: Fernando Dixon 19-2 ERA 1.93



| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MJ  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | - | 1 | 6 | 0 |
| SID | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | - | 3 | 4 | 0 |

Fernando Dixon started on short rest for this one as Sidney tried to take advantage of using up the bullpens in their Game 6 comeback. Burton had a bad inning and the bats never really woke up to threaten Dixon's dominance and the Loggers are Prairie Pacific Champions again.

* W: Fernando Dixon (1-0)
* L: Dale Burton (0-2)

PPC Champions: Sidney Loggers 4-3
