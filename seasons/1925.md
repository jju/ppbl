The Swift Current Saints were the first new winners of the Prairie Pennant since the league began, but wresting the Championship from back-to-back winning Sidney Loggers was too much of a challenge for these upstarts.

# Prairie Pacific Championship

## Game 1 
(SID 0 - SC 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SC: Albert Sanz (11-7 ERA 2.01)
* SID: Fernando Dixon (14-5 ERA 1.53)

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| SID | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | - | 4 | 8 | 1 |

It was a combined No Hit effort by the Loggers who got all the offense they needed off the bat of Dylan Hayes in the first (and then again in the 5th. They could have ridden Dixon harder, but this preserved the possibility of bringing him back to pitch in Game 4 instead of Game 5 if necessary. Sanz also wasn't overstretched so we could see a rematch if the Loggers don't pull off a sweep.

Starting Pitchers:

Another great pitching performance from the Loggers (only 3 batters over the minimum) and another Hayes Home Run has put the Saints on the brink.

## Game 4 
(SID 3 - SC 0)

Starting Pitchers:

| SC  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | - | 4 |  9 | 2 |

The Saints brought back Albert Sanz on three days' rest for this all-important elimination game. And he allowed 7(!) runs in the first inning. Even though the Saints chipped away at that lead there was no hope and they were swept.
