| SID | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 4 | - | 6 | 12 | 2 |

Haley Nguyen was a last-minute scratch from her start so Roberto Crespo was pulled into service. He did so well and had run support but then the Loggers made an epic bottom of the ninth comeback to win on a walkoff 3 run HR by Tristan Hernandez.

To make the playoffs Sidney had to use their 25-Win ace on the last game of the regular season, but now the Union got to face that pitching machine. The Union tried to stage their own dramatic comeback in the bottom of the ninth, but came up short. It's hard to think this series will be anything but a sweep.

Starting Pitchers: 
* SID Isabel Higueras Beltrán (19-3 ERA 1.69)

| WPG | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | - | 1 |  7 | 2 |

And the final game of 1926 was a tense pitchers' duel. Higueras Beltran couldn't quite manage replicating her feat in Game 155, but kept most of the Union off the board and was well deserving of the PPC MVP.
