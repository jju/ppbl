# Prairie Pacific Championship

## Game 1 
(WPG 0 - KOO 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* WPG: Salvador Brewer (13-5 ERA 2.25)
* KOO: Borja Muñoz (20-4 ERA 1.26)

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | R | H | E |

The Union got their first playoff win on the back of great pitching. Muñoz was no slouch either and the difference was Joan Cortes allowing a leadoff double in the 10th inning, which eventually came around to score.

## Game 2 
(WPG 1 - KOO 0)

An incredibly evenly matched game, but Pearson had a couple of hiccups in the 4th which made the difference.

Starting Pitchers: 
* KOO: Dwayne Wright (15-5 ERA 1.39)

Another amazing pitching duel. This time Nguyen went the distance even with a bit of a shaky ninth.

Neither starter was super-sharp, but Winnipeg kept plugging away after losing their early lead. There's going to be a lot of debate over the 8th inning and how much of an impact the blown call at first made. To recap after Aitor Velasco pitched to only 3 batters in the 7th he came back in for the 8th. Fernando Vegas led off with a strikeout and then Gustavo Navarro hit s short chopper to 3rd. The throw appeared to be in time to catch Navarro, but the umpire called him safe. There was a huge argument but only coaches were ejected. Valasco was rattled however because it only took one pitch to Martin Smith for another hit. Here's the debate space: how differently would Smith have been pitched to if there'd been 2 outs? Joan Cortes was warming up as Carmelo Alvarez came to the plate. Alvarez isn't usually a power threat but he got a hold of that one and blasted it out for a 3 run homer which ended up winning the game. Cortes followed up with the next two outs, somewhat redeeming her playoff performance in Game 1.

## Game 5
(WPG 3 - KOO 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* KOO: ~~Julian Parra (20-4 ERA 2.12)~~ Guillermo Caballero (8-3 ERA 2.08)
* WPG: ~~Clyde Pearson (13-9 ERA 2.74)~~ Rafael Dunn (16-6 ERA 2.34)

After their epic Game 2 matchup neither Julian Parra nor Clyde Pearson were available for the elimination Game 5 start, so the young Guillermo Caballero and veteran groundballer Rafael Dunn were selected. Caballero wasn't bad, but got no run support and the Winnipeg Union cruised to their first Prairie Pacific Championship.
