For the first time since 1921 we have the division winners actually being the top two teams in the league (the Union squeaked by the Loggers on Run Differential). It was also a bit of a down hitting season

# Prairie Pacific Championship

## Game 1

The flood of errors in the 8th by the Grizzlies didn't lose them the game, but it sure didn't help. Brewer put together another complete game gem and the Grizzlies are again looking at needing to beat the underdogs soon.

## Game 2 
(KOO 0 - WPG 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* WPG: Haley Nguyen (16-6 ERA 1.79)

The first half was a pitching battle but once the starters began to tire (with neither landing a knockout) it became a bullpen game and that did not go well for the Grizzlies. Only 2 runs in the top of the ninth were earned and that would have been enough to lose the match, but Tony Craig is the error-making goat they'll be hanging this loss on. Gustavo Navarro had a great game.

## Game 3 
(KOO 0 - WPG 2)

Starting Pitchers: 
* KOO: Dwayne Wright (17-8 ERA 1.83)

Clyde Pearson didn't have anything and the bats didn't get themselves together to help him out.

## Game 4 
(KOO 1 - WPG 2)

Starting Pitchers: 
* KOO: Julian Parra 0-1 (13-6 ERA 1.79)
* WPG: Roberto Crespo (5-3 ERA 2.70)

Crespo did exactly what the Union needed until Abrahamsen gave up a pile of walks including walking in the tying run. But doubles from Vegas and Lane in the ninth were enough for the walk-off win.

The Union had to throw everything they had at the Grizzlies in this game to try and close out the series. The pitching was fantastic and after Adolfo Campos made a huge play in the bottom of the ninth to rob Jasmin Howard of a double and send the game into extras it seemed like a battle of attrition was in the cards. Kootenay had the advantage in that with Steven Sawyer ready to do multiple work in extras, and it seemed he'd get his chance to shine after Rodrigo Alonso scored the slow running Jeffrey Saunders in the top of the 13th. But Jennings and Navarro delivered a bloop and a blast to win the game and the series.
