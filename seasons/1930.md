Coming into the final week of the season all the offseason moves seemed to have paid off. Moose Jaw, Winnipeg, Vancouver and Sidney were all within a win of each other and both divisions had ties. The final regular season game between the Union and the Asahi would determine which division woud require a one-game playoff. Vancouver pulled off the win sending the Union to battle the Monarchs for the Prairie Pennant.

As befitted the season ending with a tie for the Prairie Pennant it took extra innings after a series of solo home runs to decide who would win it. Now Winnipeg moves on to face Vancouver hunting for their fourth PPC title in a row.

The Union made an exciting game of it, but couldn't keep from making mistakes, the most obvious one being in the 6th when Deanna Lane lost track of a ball in the late afternoon glare and blew an easy out which came around to score.

Hiroshi was coming off a worst ever start looking for redemption and an edge before heading back to Vancouver. A 2-run homer in the bottom of the first was not how he wanted to start the game off. In the middle innings the Asahi bats helped out while Hiroshi refound his command. Bringing back Valenciano after his injury in game 1 looked premature and a bad idea when he gave up the tying runs in the ninth, but he also regrouped and the bats came around to win.
