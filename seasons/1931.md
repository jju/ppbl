Midway through the 1931 season Swift Current decided to go for broke and made a huge series of midseason trades, emptying their farm system to get relief pitching from the Kootenay Grizzlies and a better offensive catcher from the Fraser Valley Pioneers. It was enough for them to catch the Moose Jaw Monarchs but not pass them in the Win column by the end of the season, forcing another Game 155 to determine the winner of the Prairie Division.

## Game 155

|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|

| SC  | 0 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | - | - |  7 | 16 |  0 |

The Saints' midseason acquisition didn't win this game all by himself but the big 2 run homer in the 3rd showed why Swift Current emptied their farm system. Now they head to the playoffs to face off against the Sidney Loggers, who are quite definitely back in form after winning 106 games in the regular season.

## Game 1 
(SID 0 - SC 0)

The Loggers are a murderous bunch of hitters. Will they be able to tee off on their weaker competition and execute another sweep like back in [[1925]]? This team is not nearly as good as that one was, at least in getting wins. Well, they didn't and we ended up getting a very tight tense game.
