No Pennant-clinching tiebreaks needed this season as the Swift Current Saints really came into their own. The Fraser Valley Pioneers also turned their big offseason into actual wins and clinched their first ever Pacific Pennant.

# Prairie Pacific Championship

The Pioneers have a slightly younger team than the Saints but they are both highly ranked at pitching which makes a big difference

## Game 1 
(SC 0 - FV 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* FV: Domingo Diaz 19-7 ERA 1.82
* SC: Steven Reed 15-5 ERA 1.72

A game you don't want to see if you averse to pitching meltdowns. Miguel Aguilar was the hero with the 3 run blast to win the game in the bottom of the 8th, but the fact that it was a Wild Pitch thatbollocksed up the strikeout to lead off the inning meant that even though Takahiro Tsuchiya lost the game he didn't allow any Earned Runs.

* WP: Magdalena Fechner (1-0)
* LP: Takahiro Tsuchiya (0-1)

## Game 3 
(SC 1 - FV 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SC: Desiderio Mulet Dominguez 19-3 ERA 1.74
* FV: Cesar Morris 13-8 ERA 1.89

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | - | 9 | 11 | 0 |
| FV  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | - | 4 | 10 | 1 |

This game's back and forth was excellent, and the Pioneers were only a run down going into the 9th. Takahiro Tsuchiya came in for another inning of work, and gave up a home run. Then an error allowed a run scoring double and a walk and a 2 run double and he was out without retiring a soul. Has anypitcher been so snakebitten in the playoffs before?

## Game 4 
(SC 2 - FV 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SC: Brandon Moon 10-1 ERA 1.44
* FV: Domingo Diaz 19-7 ERA 1.82

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| FV  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | - | - | 2 | 7 | 0 |

The rookie pitcher of the year got to try and keep the momentum up for the Saints and Moon made it through 7 innings with only a run given up. When he was taken out the Pioneers brought in a left handed power hitter to take on Magdalena Fechner and Ricardo Herrero sent the first pitch he saw out of the park.

## Game 5
(SC 2 - FV 2)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SC: Steven Reed 
* FV: Almudena Belmonte Ãvila

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | - | 2 | 7 | 1 |
| FV  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | - | - | 3 | 7 | 1 |

Reed was looking to avoid one the bad inning he had in Game 1, and he would have if it weren't for that butter-fingered catcher. [[Miguel Aguilar]] drove in all of Swift Current's runs but was also responsible for the passed ball that allowed the 8th to continue and Alexandria Johnson to hit a 3-run homer. It appeared to some like Pioneers manager Jakob Friesen was giving the game away when he not only went with the beleaguered Takahiro Tsuchiya for the save opportunity in the 9th, but *left him in* after Miguel Aguilar hit a 2-out home run to put the tying run at the plate. Nathaniel Miller got a good hack and sent the ball just shy of the wall for game hero Alexandria Johnson to record the final out and putting Fraser Valley a win away from a Prairie Pacific Championship. All of that overshadowed Almudena Belmonte Ãvila's control issues in the 3rd inning, where she escaped a 1-out bases-loaded jam (from some wild pitching and a hit).

## Game 6
(SC 2 - FV 3)

Starting Pitchers: 
* FV: Cesar Morris 13-8 ERA 1.89 (0-1 ERA 7.50)
* SC: Mary Duran 23-1 ERA 1.13 (0-0 ERA 5.14)

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FV  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | - | 5 | 10 | 0 |
| SC  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | - | 4 | 10 | 1 |

Both starters had quality outings but in the end the Pioneers just got the job done. Takahiro Tsuchiya got 4 outs and brought his ERA down from the record high levels he had been at and the Pioneers are celebrating their first championship.
