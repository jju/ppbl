The Saints didn't come through as the prohibitive favourites of 1932, but held off a late charge by Winnipeg's sluggers to claim another pennant. Fraser Valley lived up their defending champion expectations with a best in league offense and defense. Outside of the pennant races there were amazing hit totals accumulated by Moose Jaw's Cecilia Izquierdo Mascaró and Winnipeg's Fernando Vegas.

# Prairie Pacific Championship

## Game 1 
(FV  0 - SC  0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SC: Mary Duran 17-7 ERA 1.55
* FV: Almudena Belmonte Ãvila 24-3 ERA 1.65

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X |  R |  H |  E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|

| FV  | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | - |  2 |  8 |  0 |

The first inning was the best the Saints managed in a good pitching battle between two of the season's best starting pitchers. Simón Morales Barberá was taken out of the game in the second inning after a routine play, but his shoulder appeared to be generally all right.

* WP: Almudena Belmonte Ãvila (1-0)
* LP: Mary Duran (0-1)

## Game 2 
(FV 1 - SC 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SC: Steven Reed 13-9 ERA 2.89
* FV: Cesar Morris 18-3 ERA 2.25

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | - | 2 | 5 | 0 |
| FV  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 1 | 6 | 0 |

Another pitcher's duel and another playoff loss for [[Takahiro Tsuchiya]]. This time he collected two outs and then gave up a game-winning home run (to Emery Lloyd, who was in the game so Simón Morales Barberá's shoulder could heal up a bit. Will Tsuchiya be trusted with the ball again this post-season?

* WP: Steven Reed (1-0)
* LP: Takahiro Tsuchiya (0-1)

## Game 3 
(FV 1 - SC 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* FV: Leticia Campos Bertrán 12-2 ERA 1.53
* SC: Gottlob Bolnbach 3-3 ERA 1.65

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R |  H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| FV  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |  4 | 0 |
| SC  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 12 | 1 |

The Saints and Pioneers were both throwing youth at their opponent in this matchup and both starters held up exceedingly well. Though the Pioneers didn't go straight to [[Takahiro Tsuchiya]] as a reliever, they did put him in with the bases loaded after Vanesa Baños Prado allowed the tying run. He gave up the walkoff hit.

* WP: David Smith (1-0)
* LP: Takahiro Tsuchiya (0-2)

## Game 4 
(FV 1 - SC 2)

Starting Pitchers: 
* FV: Florinda Aznar-Martinez 14-6 ERA 2.10
* SC: Domitila Bernat Marin 11-9 ERA 2.29

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X |  R |  H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| FV  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | - |  6 | 10 | 0 |
| SC  | 0 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 0 | 0 | - | - | 14 | 22 | 0 |

Just an absolute blowout. Aznar-Martinez lasted only three innings and the Saints just stomped through their lineup over and over again. The pitching wasn't great on the Saints end, but Domitila Bernat Marin helped her cause immensely with 4 RBIs (which ties her for second in the series).

* WP: Domitila Bernat Marin (1-0)
* LP: Florinda Aznar-Martinez (0-1)

## Game 5
(FV 1 - SC 3)

Starting Pitchers: 
* FV: Cesar Morris 18-3 ERA 2.25 (0-0)
* SC: Mary Duran 17-7 ERA 1.55 (0-1)

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | R |  H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| FV  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |  1 | 2 |  5 | 0 |
| SC  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  2 | 3 | 10 | 1 |

Mary Duran got the nod to try and close out the series and claim the Saints' first championship after losing a heartbreaker in Game 1. She didn't get the win, but Dawn Johnson hit a walk-off double in the 10th to get the champagne flowing.

* WP: Raul Montero (1-0)
* LP: Sherri Miller (0-1)

The Saints were the biggest underdog to win the PPC championship, coming into the series ranked 4th in the league and only a .500 record.
