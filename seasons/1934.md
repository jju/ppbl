The Sidney Loggers flexed their financial clout in the off-season and came away good enough to wrestle the Pacific Pennant from the Fraser Valley Pioneers in the final week of the season. Winnipeg made big strides after getting more pitching support to support their big bats to handily win the Prairie Pennant.

# Prairie Pacific Championship

## Game 1 
(SID 0 - WPG 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* WPG: Haley Nguyen 17-4 ERA 1.51
* SID: Ashley Cantrell 22-4 ERA 1.14

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X |  R |  H |  E |

| SID | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - |  1 |  4 |  3 |

That wasn't at all the start the Loggers wanted from their star rookie, and the veteran Nguyen just pitched a great one facing down a Loggers lineup that was very ready to hit.

## Game 2 
(SID 0 - WPG 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* WPG: Masayuki Ishiguro 14-7 ERA 1.73
* SID: Fernando Dixon 14-3 ERA 1.27

A close one until hero time came up and [[Nawel Hayden]] pulled off a blast to save the game (you may remember similar playoff heroics a dozen years ago [[1922#Game 1]] when Hayden was a backup outfielder). That his leadoff HR in the ninth din't win the game matters little to his legendary status in Sidney.

## Game 3 
(SID 1 - WPG 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SID: Salomón Navarrete Revilla 19-6 ERA 1.81
* WPG: Tyrell Orr 12-7 ERA 1.92

A clash of starters and the rookie held his own.

## Game 4 
(SID 1 - WPG 2)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SID: Tamara Fletcher 18-8 ERA 1.53
* WPG: Haley Nguyen 17-4 ERA 1.51

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| WPG | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | - | - | 4 | 7 | 0 |

Fletcher gave up 2 Home Runs while Nguyen made an excellent effort, even laying down the bunt that stood up as the game winner (after Terrance Jennings added insurance runs in the 7th). Now the Union could close things out at home.

## Game 5
(SID 1 - WPG 3)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SID: Ashley Cantrell 22-4 ERA 1.14
* WPG: Masayuki Ishiguro 14-7 ERA 1.73

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| SID | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 13 | 2 |
| WPG | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 14 | 1 |

Ashley Cantrell wanted redemption for Game 1. Ishiguro wants credit for the win that slipped away to Pineda's meltdown in Game 2. This time Ishiguro himself let his win slip away when he allowed a leadoff HR in the seventh inning. Then we had a back and forth battle sending it into extra innings where a leadoff dropped third strike by Gustavo Navarro led to the winning (unearned) runs scoring.

## Game 6
(SID 2 - WPG 3)

Starting Pitchers: 
* WPG: Clyde Pearson 16-6 ERA 1.33
* SID: Salomón Navarrete Revilla 19-6 ERA 1.81

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |

Revilla pitched an amazing 3-hit shutout and he was helped out by [[Nawel Hayden]]'s monster performance (3 RBIs with a Home Run) forcing a Game 7 where the Loggers have home field advantage.

(SID 3 - WPG 3)

Starting Pitchers: 

* WPG: Haley Nguyen 17-4 ERA 1.51

It's been [[1924|ten years]] since our last PPC Game 7 (which the Loggers won) and we're being treated to a pitching rematch of Game 4. [[Hunter Harvey]] and [[Fernando Dixon]] who played in that last Game 7 were available in the bullpen, but didn't need to be used since the Loggers pulled off the walkoff win for another PPC Title. Michelle Barrett got the tying double, stole a base and then waltzed in on [[Dylan Hayes]]' single to right. An amazing game and a great series.
