Going into the 1935 season, it looked like we would be seeing another season of Pacific Division dominance. While the Giants had 3 more wins than their historically bad [[1934]] season it was the Grizzlies that really powered through, capturing the Pacific Pennant over the Fraser Valley Pioneers. The Winnipeg Union easily won the Prairies by getting at least a little bit lucky. In general it was a year of less dominant pitching,with no starters getting up to 20 wins due to increased bullpen usage.

# Prairie Pacific Championship

The championship series is all about Speed vs Power. Despite being underdogs, the Union have the best pitcher in the league lined up for taking the mound 3 times if necessary.

## Game 1 
(KOO 0 - WPG 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* WPG: Haley Nguyen 17-8 ERA 2.13
* KOO: Guillermo Caballero 11-5 ERA 2.21

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X |  R |  H |  E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| WPG | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | - |  3 |  8 |  2 |
| KOO | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | - | - |  6 | 12 |  1 |

Nguyen didn't have her best stuff, giving up her only 2 HRs of the season, and she wasn't helped when the vaunted Winnipeg defense made two errors early. No huge heroics were necessary on the Grizzlies side.

* LP: Haley Nguyen (0-1)

## Game 2 
(KOO 1 - WPG 0)

Starting Pitchers:

Old-fashioned pitchers' duel with a pair of complete games.

| WPG | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | - | 3 | 7 | 0 |

Another pitcher's duel, with Pearson even bunting in his own run early. But in the bottom of the ninth  Jasmin Howard hit a walkoff homer.

## Game 4 
(KOO 2 - WPG 1)

| WPG | 1 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | - | 6 | 7 | 0 |

The best pitcher of the regular season stepped to the mound to get some revenge for a less-than-good Game 1, and delivered a 2-hit shutout while her teammates gave her loads of run support.

* WP: Haley Nguyen (1-1)
* LP: Guillermo Caballero (1-1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* KOO: Joshua Bowers
* WPG: Masayuki Ishiguro

| WPG | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 1 | 4 | 0 |

Two complete games from the starters after shaky first innings, but the Grizzlies take the series lead on a home run by Steven West.
