While the Pioneers ran away with the Pacific division in 1936, the Saints [[SC]] and Union [[WPG]] fought it out to the very last two-game series in Swift Current. Winnipeg was a game behind but still favoured to pull off the sweep, but in the final game Swift Current came back with a 7-4 victory on the back of [[Dawn Johnson]]'s brave performance.

[[Miguel Aguilar]] won the Hitter of the year award based on the regular season, but the votes were very close between him and [[Emiliana Murcia Peiró]]. That they would end up facing off in the Prairie Pacific Championship made for a good bit of drama in the postseason.

# Prairie Pacific Championship

## Game 1 
(FV 0 - SC 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SC: Desiderio Mulet Dominguez 8-1 ERA 1.95
* FV: Cesar Morris 13-4 ERA 1.86

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X |  R |  H |  E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| SC | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - |  0 |  6 |  0 |
| FV | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | - |  4 |  6 |  0 |

[[Cesar Morris]] pitched well and the Pioneers took the lead. Aguilar had a lousy game going 0 for 3, though a hard hit ball to centre to lead off the ninth put the Fraser Valley fans' hearts in their mouths. Murciana Peiro, however, scored the games opening run after a leadoff single, drove in 3 runs with a homer in the fifth and hit a double in the 8th, handily showing why she should have taken the hitter's crown this season.

* WP: Cesar Morris 1-0
* LP: Desiderio Mulet Dominguez 0-1

## Game 2 
(FV 1 - SC 0)

Starting Pitchers: 
* SC: Gottlob Bolnbach
* FV: Leticia Campos Bertrán

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| FV | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | - | 2 | 5 | 0 |

A beauty of a game that gave the Pioneers a commanding lead. [[Miguel Aguilar]] didn't try to do too much, but drew walks and almost hit one out in the 8th to take a lead, but again [[Emiliana Murcia Peiró]] got a home run to keep the hitting display going. Marcos Reyes-Agustí was the player of the game, with a Double and the walkoff HR.

* WP: Masashi Okada (1-0)
* LP: Aitor Velasco (0-1)

## Game 3 
(FV 2 - SC 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* FV: Ivan Calvo
* SC: Steven Reed

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FV | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | - | 4 | 6 | 1 |
| SC | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | - | 5 | 7 | 0 |

Coming home, the Saints knew they had to work hard to start evening things up and Reed worked a beauty of a game for them while the hitters got Calvo out of the game early. There was a bit of a scare for the Swift Current fans as the Pioneers staged a ninth inning comeback, but Velasco stranded the tying run at third base to preserve the win.

* WP: Steven Reed (1-0)
* LP: Ivan Calvo (0-1)

## Game 4 
(FV 2 - SC 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* FV: Domingo Diaz (replacement)
* SC: Desiderio Mulet Dominguez

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | X | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FV | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 0 | - | 9 | 17 | 0 |
| SC | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 1 |  2 | 2 |

This was Dwight Evans' game. Four hits, including a home run and a double. Diaz pitched a good one to regain the momentum for the Pioneers.

* WP: Domingo Diaz (1-0)
* LP: Desiderio Mulet Dominguez (0-1)

## Game 5 
(FV 3 - SC 1)

Starting Pitchers: 
* FV: Cesar Morris
* SC: Gottlob Bolnbach

| Inn | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | R | H | E |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FV  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 11 | 0 |
| SC  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 0 |

The Saints made it interesting in the bottom of the ninth, but [[Marcos Reyes-Agustí]] got a leadoff double in the 10th, [[Alexandria Johnson]] moved him to third and [[Dwight Evans]] sent him home with a fly ball deep enough to left. And the best team in the regular season won the championship.

* WP: Vanesa Baños Prado (1-0) though she blew the save in the ninth.
* LP: Aitor Velasco (0-2)
