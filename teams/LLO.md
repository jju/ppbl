# Lloydminster Giants

After 14 years the Lloydminster Giants are the only team in the Prairie Pacific Baseball League to not win a pennant. They broke into the top half of the league rankings only once in [[1923]] and since then have been mired in futility. After the crash of 1929 ownership became unhappy with the team and started pushing for more cost savings and profits if they weren't going to be competitive. They began a new contract regime which traded away players as soon as they developed enough clout to demand more pay (from some other team). A series of these trades with the [[VCR|Vancouver Asahi]] (sometimes described as a raid, especially in the post-war years) led to former Giants winning a pennant.

## Management

In the aftermath of 1929's economic difficulties Lloydminster's ownership questioned why they were paying players the most in the league and still had no real results. They commenced a massive spree of unbalanced trades in the offseason.
