# Swift Current Saints

The Swift Current Saints began their time in the PPL in the shadows of their Prairie competitors, especially the [[MJ|Moose Jaw Monarchs]]. They snuck into the Championship in 1925 when they were demolished by the [[SID|Loggers]]. In the 1930s though, while other teams were tightening their economic belts Swift Current began spending to make their team great. They found trades and got a bona fide star in the middle of the 1931 season. It didn't work out with a championship that year but they began a dominating run.
