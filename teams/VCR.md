# Vancouver Asahi

The Asahi came into the PPL as the best team and wiped the floor with the rest of the teams in the inaugural season. Since then they've had much stiffer competition and have also diversified their player pool beyond the Japanese-Canadian community (especially as the other teams started scouting Japanese-Canadian players).

The Great Depression saw a major shift in the Asahi approach when funding became more important for PPL teams. They performed a raid on the [[LLO|Lloydminster Giants]] roster to dramatically bolster their roster, which led to some wags referring to them as the Vancouver Giants. The quasi-official nickname was fortuitous as there was greater consternation in the Vancouver Japanese-Canadian community that they wanted a team just for them. By 1931 the PPL team relinquished the Asahi name to the community and rebranded as the Kyojin (which means Giants in Japanese).
