# Vancouver Asahi

The Asahi came into the PPL as the best team and wiped the floor with the rest of the teams in the inaugural season. Since then they've had much stiffer competition and have also diversified their player pool beyond the Japanese-Canadian community (especially as the other teams started scouting Japanese-Canadian players).
